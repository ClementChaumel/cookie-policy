links to the latest versions of the JS and CSS.

### Options
You can configure the cookie policy with the following options.

#### Message:
You can edit to cookie policy message by passing the setup function an options
object with a content value. For example:

``` javascript
var options = {
  'content': 'We use cookies to improve your experience.'
}
```

#### Timed destruction
You can make the cookie policy self distruct in time but passing a duration as
an option. Duration is measured in milliseconds.

``` javascript
var options = {
  'duration': 3000
}
```

Note: It is recommended you add a link to your cookie policy in the footer of
your wesbite when using this option.

var options = {
  'content': 'We use cookies to improve your experience. By your continued use of this site you accept such use.<br /> This notice will disappear by itself. To change your settings please <a href="https://www.ubuntu.com/legal/terms-and-policies/privacy-policy#cookies">see our policy</a>.',
  'duration': 3000
}
ubuntu.cookiePolicy.setup(options);
```
